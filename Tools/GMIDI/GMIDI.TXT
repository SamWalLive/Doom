Differences from GMID 1.1:
        - Filesize problem fixed.
        - More accurate Tempo translation. (i hope)
        - Looping not starting from beginning problem fixed.
        - Added /d option to remove patches made for channel 10 (drums).


   This is the new program to interconvert Dark Forces .GMD files (as well as
LFD GMID resources) and standard MIDI files.

The usage is pretty simple:

Gmidi file.mid [file.gmd] [/l] [/d] or
Gmidi file.gmd [file.mid] [/c]      or
Gmidi makefile.txt /m

Add /c switch to force generating a makefile (normally makefiles are generated
only when needed - when GMD file contains more than one MIDI track).
Add /m switch to force treating the first file as a text makefile. (must use)
Add /l switch (experimental) to make the melody loop
Add /d switch to remove channel 10 patches. (Usally sounds better)

Normally, the program examines the file and does the appropriate conversion
automatically.  It's a good idea to use default extensions (.gmd for GMD
files, .mid for MIDI files and .txt for makefiles) anyway. MIDI formats 0 and 
1 are supported.

	A single GMD file can contain several MIDI tracks. If it does, the
program treats the name of the second file you specify (or the first if you
don't specify it) as a template, i.e.

gmid star-thm.gmd

will create 6 MIDI files - star-t00.mid to star-t05.mid. Also, it will also
create a makefile star-thm.txt containing:

GMD star-thm.GMD
star-t00.mid
star-t01.mid
star-t02.mid
star-t03.mid
star-t04.mid
star-t05.mid

later you can use:

gmid star-thm.txt /m

to recreate the star-thm.gmd file.

The program is free. The author is not responsible for any damage to

Note. This program should be placed in itïs own subdirectory. It will
 overwrite files without confirmation.
