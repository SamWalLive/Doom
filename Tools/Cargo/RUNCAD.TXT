                             RUNCAD CarGo 95

  This is my stand-alone system detection program. I designed this version
to create a file called FMECAD.LOG that will reflect your current setup.
This file has important information like your computers current setup and 
total system resources both free and available.
  Another version of RUNCAD's detection has been incorporated into FMECAD's
startup sequence. Again, an FMECAD.LOG file is created. This will serve as your
current log of system resources at startup. Why?.............
  Cause it looks cool... Actually, I ask all who try FMECAD to send me their
log files. You see, not all computers are created equal and as much could be
said for some who operate them. A definate Freudian puzzle. So in the
interest of tranquility, The conflicts, if any, need to be solved.
  I'll admit that I designed FMECAD for 800x600 resolution and required a
minimum of 1meg free of XMS but hey, it looks cool. Oh yea, thayyyyyyy-kh-u
