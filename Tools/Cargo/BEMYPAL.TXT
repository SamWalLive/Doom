                        BEMYPAL  CarGo 95

        Not much to it here. Just load one from the command line and adjust.
The palette file must exist and be 768 bytes or out you go. The saved file 
will be BEMYPAL.PAL ready to be renamed. I loaded a default 256 color palette 
and acid city! 
  By the way, left mouse button to pick a color and left to adjust up and
right to adjust down.
