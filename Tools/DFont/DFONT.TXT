                 DFONT - THE DARK FORCES FNT FILES OPERATOR
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          (C) Peter Klassen,1997
                                Version 1.0



1. What is DFONT?
-----------------
Some of you will ask themself, what this proggie is for. I mean, there is qui-
te nothing in the Dark Forces game that is still unexplored thanks to many
dedicated persons to whom I am very grateful. But I felt somehow that one
aspect has been walked around- the FNT files. I mean the fonts which are
contained in DARK.GOB (not the FON resources from MENU.LFD & STANDARD.LFD).
They are used to display ammo, shields, screen messages, map levels etc.
And I could bet someone already played with the thought to create an own
font for DF to use it for screen messages, or update the old one so different
colors can be used (like to make a dialog between Katarn and someone else).
Or someone is really hot to make an internationalisation for the DF to be able
to display Cyrillic, Chinese or whatever characters. Well, if you are one
of such people, this program is the right one for you.

OK, if you just want to make a different font, you can use the SWFONT1.FNT
(also in DARK.GOB). It makes the text messages in a blueish color and is a bit
better to read.

This program works much like Alex Novikov's BMPDF or GMID (ingenuine programs,
every DF level creator should have 'em!). It decompiles the valid DF font
(the validation is checked) to single PCX files, where the filename is the
decimal code of the character. So, the letter 'A' is found under '065.PCX',
'B'-'066.PCX' etc. The font doesn't need to be complete (you needn't declare
unneeded characters- see AMONUM.FNT or similar), but there may be NO gaps.
That means, if you have an idea to make a font from #33 to #126 and then
the German Umlauts, you have to fill the gaps between the letters(the accent
letters) by PCX pictures, too. Therefore, you just need to make a 256 color
1x1 PCX with the only coloring 0, save it and copy to the proper file names.
Just a little bit of work.

But that's not all. With the switch "/V" the program is able to show the
font on display without decompiling it. And the "/P:palfile.pal" switch
will use another DF-standard-palette instead of the default one when
displaying/decompiling fonts.

The (re)compilation is performed by a makefile (see below).


2. To what will the DFONT decompile the FNT exactly?
----------------------------------------------------
OK, the FNT font will be decompiled to a set of PCX files (v 5). If
you specify a specific palette, the decompiled PCXs will have this palette,
too. The PCX filenames are ranged from 000.PCX to 255.PCX. If the font is
not complete (the DF ones are all incomplete), only the existing characters
will be decompiled.
Then, a text makefile with the name of the font is created. It contains some
general font properties, and the list of files. See below in chapter "The
makefile". So, if you decompile the font "AMONUM.FNT", the makefile is called
"AMONUM.TXT".


3. What may I do when changing the font?
----------------------------------------
Ok, after you've decompiled the stuff, you may edit it with a picture editor
of your choice. I recommend one with zoom possibility and direct palette
access. So you're sure that the color you chose really will be of equal brigh-
tness in all rooms and that the background is transparent and not opaque
black.
Yet one thing, the font can't exceed 100x100 size. But anyway, who will
need such a font where you can hardly see 3 letters on the screen?

And by the way, when editing internally-used fonts (like Amonum, Armnum,
Superwep, Helnum, Map-nums .fnt) which are used to display ammo, health
and layers on map (what I don't recommend), keep the character extensions
like they were, or the picture on the display will be mixed up.


4. How can I (re)compile the font?
----------------------------------

Well, the only way to recompile 't is thru the makefile. It has to have the
extension "TXT" or it won't be recognized. The file is analysed, the listed
files will be read, and the font will be recompiled to a brandnew one.
The height is read from all the pictures and the largest is chosen, so don't
worry about it. Yet, there are some settings in the makefile to be set,
so read the chapter "The makefile".
When the font is ready, test it first by copying into your Dark directory
and renaming by the name of the font you want to replace. Then test it.
When everything is right (what I hope), put it into your level project.



5. The usage:
-------------
There are some of the command switches which are shown if DFONT is started
without parameters or with "/?" switch. These are:

To display:
DFONT FONTNAME.FNT /V [/P:palfile.pal]
   where
     FONTNAME.FNT   is a valid DF font,
     /V             means "Display Font",
     /P:palfile.pal uses external DF-compatible palette to display.

To decompile:
DFONT FONTNAME.FNT [/P:palfile.pal]
   where
     FONTNAME.FNT   is a valid DF font,
     /P:palfile.pal uses external DF-compatible palette to be used.

To compile:
DFONT MAKEFILE.TXT
   where
     MAKEFILE.TXT    is a valid makefile.



6. The makefile.
----------------
I made good experience with Alex's makefile technique and therefore, use
a similar one. You may use both upper and lower cases, and spaces.
If some file specified in the makefile can't be found, the program will
terminate.

The syntax:

***
REMARKS:         <not required>

usage:  # xxxxxxxxx

 where # is the at the beginning of the line. The text after it won't be
 interpreted.

Example:
# This letter has been changed.

***
INDIR=           <not required>

 INDIR is used to find the PCX files. The program presumes that they are
 placed in the path specified. There is no check if this directory exists.

usage: INDIR=path\
 where "path\" is a valid DOS path with a closing backslash.

Example:
INDIR:=C:\MYDATA\PCX\

***
OUTDIR=          <not required>

 OUTDIR is used to estimate where the compiled font will be placed. There
 is no check if this path exists.

usage: OUTDIR=path\
 where "path\" is a valid DOS path with a closing backslash.

Example:
OUTDIR:=C:\MYDATA\FONT\

***
FILE=            <required>

 The FILE variable is used to estimate a filename of the font. The font
 will be created under the name OUTDIR+FILE. You also could specify the
 complete destination path under FILE, but avoid doing this in combinati-
 on with the OUTDIR variable.

usage: FILE=XXX.FNT
 where XXX.FNT is the dest font filename. You also need to type in the
 extension.

Example:
FILE=GLOWING.FNT

***
SPACE=          <not required>

 SPACE specifies the space between single letters in pixel. For example, the
 space between chars of GLOWING.FNT is 0, the one of SWFONT1.FNT is 1.

usage: SPACE=X
 where X is a decimal number. If invalid values are specified, the default
 space of 1 is used.

Example:
SPACE=1

***
XXX=           <at least one required>

 specifies a specific PCX picture to the ASCII code XXX. The items need not
 to be sorted.

usage: XXX=YYY.PCX

 where XXX is a decimal number from 0 to 255 and YYY is the filename of the
 PCX.

Example:
033=033.PCX




The example makefile for ARMNUM.TXT looks like this:

#  DFONT makefile
# SPACE means space between characters
# INDIR & OUTDIR paths must end with a backslash, like: C:\FONTS\
INDIR=
OUTDIR=
FILE=ARMNUM.FNT
SPACE=1
048=048.PCX
049=049.PCX
050=050.PCX
051=051.PCX
052=052.PCX
053=053.PCX
054=054.PCX
055=055.PCX
056=056.PCX
057=057.PCX
058=058.PCX

7. The package
--------------

This package consists of the following files:
 DFONT.EXE   - The program itself
 DFONT.TXT   - This file
 GLOW_RU.FNT - Example custom font: cyrillic version of GLOWING.FNT. The
               characters #128-#175 and #224-#239 are cyrillic.

8. About this program.
----------------------
This program is created by me, Peter Klassen, in Borland Pascal 7.0. I made
it in ca. 3 days and am pretty proud of it. Of course, it is freeware, for
I do not feel it is SO necessary to be paid for. But if you used it for your
level, give me credits.
This program does not use extended or expanded memory, it's pure DOS.
As this program is FREEWARE, I can't be held responsible for any harm it
caused on your machine, inclusive data losses, virus attacks, head crashes :-)
No, earnest, it has been tested often enough to be sure.
At the same cause (=FREEWARE) you may distribute it among other DF level cre-
ators (I don't see why somebody other should have interest for it), of
course if you deliver this text, too.


9. About me
-----------
Well, well, what can I say about myself? I am a 19 year old Pascal & VB coder
and am studying Delphi by now. This program I created to learn some file ope-
rations and because I was wondering, if I manage it to the end. As you see,
I did. Cool. :-) Maybe now I will release some new fonts for DF: the Briefing
font, some others, the Glowing with different color or so. Maybe. If I have
time.
I am since almost 2 years a DF fan and have created quite a bit to be proud
of:
BESP.3DO   A 3DO of a Cloud Car. I planned to make a Bespin level, but as
           there already were one, I let it be. But the 3DO is there. All
           manual work, only a text editor and a paper sheet!
DFBV       Dark Forces Briefing Viewer. From the era of pre-WDFUSE-times,
           as there was no possibility to make own briefings in LFD. 'T is
           a small program which simulates the briefing screen and gets
           a text specified. Really old, obsolete stuff.
DFFONT 1.5 the DF briefing font for Windows. Excellent for creating own
           briefings. Western & Cyrillic version.
YAVIN and
YAV_CUT    My first level: Back To Yavin. The Editor's Choice of the Crow's
           Nest. The assistant of Jan Dodonna has been forgotten at the
           former Rebel base on 4th moon of Yavin. Yet worse, he had the only
           copy of the data tapes with locations of the whole Rebel fleet!..
           If you didn't play it - GET IT! With optional cutscenes
           as YAV_CUT.
OPTDF      A small tool which compresses DF text resources by removing
           multiple spaces and unneeded comments. The WDFUSE LEV files
           are only ca. 80% of their origiginal size after compressing,
           3DOs can get to 50% of their original size!
BOUNTY and
BOU_CUT    My second DF level. Also got an Editor's Choice at The Crow's
           Nest. Kyle gets a chance to make peace with Jabba if he captures
           Han Solo who has been trapped on a smuggler base... but there are
           also other bounty-hunters... and the Empire searching for Rebel
           traces... and yet you do little know the truth...
           With optional cutscenes as BOU_CUT.
           *Remark* Bounty has some problems(=crashes) on loading when being
           started on MED or HARD. EASY works. As soon as I get out what's
           wrong, I'll release a patch to correct the thing.
