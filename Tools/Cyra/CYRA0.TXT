                                                           CYRA  CarGo 95


                    Welcome fellow wax makers, let's begin.

    First of all, you may be wondering what Cyra is and what Cyra can do.
    Cyra is the culmination of all of my work in hacking waxes over the
    summer. It's been a real ride.
    
    Cyra is a sequencer/editor/viewer for DF's animated cells and frames
    and sequences and waxes. Yes there is a grouping of "waxes" within
    most wax files. Everything in a wax file is based around the cell.
    Waxes point to sequences, sequences point to frames and frames point
    to cells. You won't need to know any of that stuff cause Cyra has
    been written as a GUI of sorts and keeps track of that stuff for you.

    Cyra also knows Fmecad. That means you can convert DF's Wax files
    into Fmecad's Pac files for editing/drawing and load a group of Pac
    files for conversion to Wax format. Also, you can view any Pac file
    through Cyra's Pacview routine. Sound interesting?

    Well, well, well... Through Cyra's Config section, you can change
    PacDir and WaxDir and PalDir on the fly assuming they are set
    up properly beforehand. A valid PalDir must have a 768 byte file
    named Bemypal.pal in it and a valid PacDir must have at least one
    valid Pac file, from 1.pac to 200.pac, in it and a valid WaxDir must
    have at least one Wax file in it. Need a Bemypal.pal file? Either
    rename one of DF's or download BEMYPAL CarGo 95. Need a Pac file?
    Download FMECAD CarGo 95 or the shareware FRAMED CarGo 95.
    Here is my directory structure on my puter.
    c:\
       DF\
          FMECAD\
                 FMECAD.EXE
                 PACFILES.PAC
                 BEMYPAL.PAL
          WAX\
                 DFWAXES.WAX



                                Start up

    Some first time directory setup needs to be performed by you before
    firing it up for the first time. Reread the previous paragraph and
    come back here when you are finished.
    When editing directorys in Cyra's Config section, a backslash MUST
    end the line. So.. "PACDIR:c:\df\fmecad" will not work while
    "WAXDIR:c:\df\wax\" will be accepted.

                               
                              Windows 95
    
    Works very well. Try loading several occurances of Cyra then 
    ALT-TAB yourself around. Cyra uses no extended memory and loads waxes
    and pacs individually from the hard drive. Since that is the case, each
    cell in a wax will be decompressed then displayed simultaneously. And
    you will notice that Pac frames display much faster since there is no
    compression to deal with and the Pac frames are shot to the screen
    as one picture instead of pixel by pixel.
 
    Cyra is keyboard controlled and displays in either text mode for editing
    or graphics mode 320 x 200 x 256 for showing the pics.
